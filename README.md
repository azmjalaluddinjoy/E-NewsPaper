(Background) 
Traditionally the newspapers is printed in the news pages and customer buy it. I've have a concept on making it as E-NewsPaper that makes a solution, possible for publishers to effortlessly publish their content in a digital newspaper format.
Considering the rapid growth and evolving trends in the digital media market, I want to upgrade it as on-line newspaper platform to the latest technology which allows publishers to take their digital editions to superior levels and provide a great reading experience to their users. This solution provides a reading experience that is flexible, accurate, and secure. All at an affordable cost for publishers.

Technology I've used to develop this web based software:

Type: Web Based Software
Backend Programming Language: Python
Framework: Django 2.0
Front End: Html, Css, Bootstrap, Javascript, Ajax.
